<BR />
PAYMENTS, TAXES, AND REFUND POLICY<BR />
<BR />
You agree that you will pay for all products you purchase through the Services, and that Apple may charge your payment method for any products purchased and for any additional amounts (including any taxes and late fees, as applicable) that may be accrued by or in connection with your Account. YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE TIMELY PAYMENT OF ALL FEES AND FOR PROVIDING APPLE WITH A VALID PAYMENT METHOD FOR PAYMENT OF ALL FEES. For details of how purchases are billed please visit http://support.apple.com/kb/HT5582.<BR />
<BR />
Your total price will include the price of the product plus any applicable sales tax; such sales tax is based on the bill-to address and the sales tax rate in effect at the time you download the product. We will charge tax only in states where digital goods are taxable.<BR />
<BR />
All sales and rentals of products are final.<BR />
<BR />
Prices for products offered via the Services may change at any time, and the Services do not provide price protection or refunds in the event of a price reduction or promotional offering.<BR />
<BR />
If a product becomes unavailable following a transaction but prior to download, your sole remedy is a refund. If technical problems prevent or unreasonably delay delivery of your product, your exclusive and sole remedy is either replacement or refund of the price paid, as determined by Apple.<BR />
<BR />
1-Click®<BR />
<BR />
1-Click is a registered service mark of Amazon.com, Inc., used under license. 1-Click is a convenient feature that allows you to make a purchase from the Services with a single click of your mouse or other input device. When accessing the Services on your computer, 1-Click purchasing may be activated via the dialog that appears when you click a Buy button. (You may reset this selection at any time by clicking Reset Warnings in your Account information). When accessing the Services on your Apple-branded products running iOS such as an iPad, iPod touch, or iPhone (“iOS Device”), 1-Click is activated for each transaction by tapping the button showing the price of the product, which reveals the Buy button. When 1-Click is activated, clicking or tapping the Buy button starts the download immediately and completes your transaction without any further steps.<BR />
<BR />
GIFT CERTIFICATES, ITUNES CARDS AND CODES, ALLOWANCES, AND CONTENT CODES <BR />
<BR />
Gift Certificates, iTunes Cards and Codes, and Allowances are issued and managed by Apple Value Services, LLC (“Issuer”).<BR />
<BR />
Gift Certificates, iTunes Cards and Codes, Content Codes, and Allowances, in addition to unused balances, are not redeemable for cash and cannot be returned for a cash refund (except as required by law); exchanged; resold; used to purchase Gifts, Gift Certificates, or iTunes Cards or Codes; used to provide Allowances; used for purchases on the Apple Online Store; or used in Apple Retail Stores.

The Gift Certificate/iTunes Card/Code cash value is 1/10 of one cent.<BR />
<BR />
Neither Issuer nor Apple is responsible for lost or stolen Gift Certificates, iTunes Cards or Codes, Content Codes, or Allowances. Risk of loss and title for Gift Certificates, iTunes Cards and Codes, and Allowances transmitted electronically pass to the purchaser in Virginia upon electronic transmission to the recipient. Risk of loss and title for Content Codes transmitted electronically pass in California upon electronic transmission from Apple; for avoidance of doubt, such recipient may not always be you.<BR />
<BR />
Apple reserves the right to close accounts and request alternative forms of payment if a Gift Certificate, iTunes Card or Code, Content Code, or Allowance is fraudulently obtained or used on the Service.<BR />
<BR />
APPLE, ISSUER, AND THEIR LICENSEES, AFFILIATES, AND LICENSORS MAKE NO WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO GIFT CERTIFICATES, ITUNES CARDS OR CODES, CONTENT CODES, ALLOWANCES, OR THE ITUNES STORE, APP STORE, MAC APP STORE, OR IBOOKS STORE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. IN THE EVENT THAT A GIFT CERTIFICATE, ITUNES CARD OR CODE, CONTENT CODE, OR ALLOWANCE IS NONFUNCTIONAL, YOUR SOLE REMEDY, AND OUR SOLE LIABILITY, SHALL BE THE REPLACEMENT OF SUCH GIFT CERTIFICATE, ITUNES CARD OR CODE, CONTENT CODE, OR ALLOWANCE. THESE LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. CERTAIN STATE LAWS DO NOT ALLOW LIMITATIONS ON IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF CERTAIN DAMAGES. IF THESE LAWS APPLY TO YOU, SOME OR ALL OF THE ABOVE DISCLAIMERS, EXCLUSIONS, OR LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE ADDITIONAL RIGHTS.<BR />
<BR />
GIFTS<BR />
<BR />
Gifts purchased from the Services may be purchased only for, and redeemed only by, persons in the United States, its territories, and possessions. Gift recipients must have compatible hardware and parental control settings to utilize some gifts.<BR />
<BR />
PRE-ORDERS<BR />
<BR />
By pre-ordering products, you are authorizing the Services to automatically charge your account and download the product when it becomes available. You may cancel your pre-order prior to the time the item becomes available.<BR />
<BR />
FAMILY SHARING<BR />
<BR />
Family Sharing allows you to share eligible iTunes, App Store, Mac App Store, and iBooks Store products with up to six members (including yourself) of a “Family.” If you set up or join a Family, you may view the eligible products of other Family members and download such products to your compatible device or computer. You can also choose to hide purchases so that other Family members will not be able to view or download them from you. You can share information such as photos and videos via the Photo app, events via your Family Calendar, reminders via the Reminders app, location information via Find My Friends, and device location via Find My iPhone. Family Sharing is for personal, non-commercial use only. iTunes and iCloud accounts are required; iOS 8 and/or OS X Yosemite are required to start and join a Family. Certain transactions and features may not be compatible with earlier software and may require a software upgrade. If you join a Family, the features of Family Sharing are enabled on your compatible devices and computers automatically.<BR />
<BR />
The “Organizer” of a Family can invite other members to participate in the Family. The Organizer must be 18 years or older and must have an eligible payment method registered with iTunes. If you are an Organizer, you represent that you are the parent or legal guardian of any Family member under age 13. The Organizer&#39;s payment method is used to pay for any purchase initiated by a Family member in excess of any store credit in such initiating Family member’s account. Products are associated with the account of the Family member who initiated the transaction. BY INVITING FAMILY MEMBERS TO JOIN A FAMILY, THE ORGANIZER AGREES THAT ALL FAMILY MEMBER PURCHASES ARE AUTHORIZED BY AND ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE ORGANIZER, EVEN IF THE ORGANIZER WAS UNAWARE OF ANY PARTICULAR PURCHASE, IF A FAMILY MEMBER EXCEEDED HIS OR HER AUTHORITY AS GRANTED BY THE ORGANIZER, OR IF MULTIPLE FAMILY MEMBERS PURCHASE THE SAME PRODUCT. THE ORGANIZER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPLIANCE WITH ANY AGREEMENT WITH ITS PAYMENT METHOD PROVIDER, AND ASSUMES ALL RISK IN THE EVENT THAT SHARING ACCESS TO SUCH PAYMENT METHOD LIMITS ANY PROTECTION OFFERED BY THE PAYMENT METHOD PROVIDER. The Organizer can change the payment method on file at any time. A record of the purchase will be sent to the initiating Family member and the Organizer, even if the purchase is hidden by the Family member; please use Report a Problem on your receipt if you or your Family members do not recognize charges on your receipt or payment method statement. <BR />
<BR />
The Organizer can use the Ask to Buy function to require children under the age of 18 to obtain permission from the Organizer, and/or other adults designated by the Organizer, to download free or paid products before a purchase or download commences. Products downloaded from Family members and products acquired via redemption codes are not subject to Ask to Buy. If you are an Organizer, you represent that you and/or any adult designee is the parent or legal guardian of any Family member for whom Ask to Buy is activated. Ask to Buy is optimized for iOS 8 and OS X Yosemite; product purchase or download requests from earlier software may present users with an alternative permission process or prevent purchases altogether, and may require a software upgrade. Apple is not responsible for any harm resulting from a delay in Ask to Buy approvals or denials.  <BR />
<BR />
The Organizer may remove any Family member from the Family, which will terminate that Family member&#39;s ability to initiate authorized purchases on the Organizer&#39;s payment method, and that Family Member’s ability to view and share other Family members&#39; products and information. When a Family member leaves or is removed from a Family, the remaining Family members may no longer be able to view or download the departing member’s products or information, or access products previously downloaded from the departing Family member, including purchases made on the Organizer&#39;s payment method while the departing member was part of the Family. Similarly, if you leave a Family, you may no longer be able to view or download the products or information of the other Family members, and products that you downloaded from other Family members while a member of the Family may no longer be accessible. If you have made In-App Purchases from an app originally purchased by a departed Family member or downloaded from a Family member and you no longer belong to the Family, you need to purchase the app yourself and restore the In-App Purchases to regain access to them; please review the developer’s policies and the section of this Agreement entitled “In-App Purchases” before buying In-App Purchases. Because personal accounts for users under age 13 can only be created as part of Family Sharing, deleting such an account in order to remove it from the Family will terminate that Family member’s Apple ID and his or her ability to access any Apple services that require an Apple ID or any content associated with that Apple ID.  <BR />
<BR />
You can only belong to one Family at a time, and may join any Family no more than twice per year. You can change the store account you associate with a Family no more than once every 90 days. All Family members must use the same iTunes Store country or region. Music, movies, TV shows and books can be downloaded from the iTunes Service on up to 10 devices per account, only five of which can be computers; eligible apps can be downloaded to any devices the Family member owns or controls. Not all products, including In-App Purchases, content that is not available for re-download, subscriptions, and some previously purchased apps, are eligible for Family Sharing. Apple reserves the right to disband a Family in accordance with the “Termination” section of this Agreement.  <BR />
<BR />
ELECTRONIC CONTRACTING<BR />
<BR />
Your use of the Services includes the ability to enter into agreements and/or to make transactions electronically. YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOUR ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS CONSTITUTE YOUR AGREEMENT AND INTENT TO BE BOUND BY AND TO PAY FOR SUCH AGREEMENTS AND TRANSACTIONS. YOUR AGREEMENT AND INTENT TO BE BOUND BY ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS APPLIES TO ALL RECORDS RELATING TO ALL TRANSACTIONS YOU ENTER INTO ON THIS SITE, INCLUDING NOTICES OF CANCELLATION, POLICIES, CONTRACTS, AND APPLICATIONS. In order to access and retain your electronic records, you may be required to have certain hardware and software, which are your sole responsibility.<BR />

B. ITUNES STORE TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR />
<BR />
THIS LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND APPLE INC. (&#34;APPLE&#34;) GOVERNS YOUR USE OF THE ITUNES STORE SERVICE (THE “ITUNES SERVICE”).<BR />
<BR />
THE ITUNES STORE SERVICE<BR />
<BR />
Apple is the provider of the iTunes Service, which permits you to access, purchase or rent digital content (&#34;iTunes Products&#34;) for end user use only under the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement.<BR />
<BR />
REQUIREMENTS FOR USE OF THE ITUNES SERVICE<BR />
<BR />
Only persons age 13 years or older can create accounts.  Accounts for persons under 13 years old can be created by a parent or legal guardian using Family Sharing or by an approved educational institution.  Children under the age of majority should review this Agreement with their parent or guardian to ensure that the child and parent or legal guardian understand it. <BR />
<BR />
The iTunes Service is available to you only in the United States, its territories, and possessions. You agree not to use or attempt to use the iTunes Service from outside these locations. Apple may use technologies to verify your compliance.<BR />
<BR />
Use of the iTunes Service requires compatible devices, Internet access, and certain software (fees may apply); may require periodic updates; and may be affected by the performance of these factors. High-speed Internet access is strongly recommended for regular use and is required for video. The latest version of required software is recommended to access the iTunes Service and may be required for certain transactions or features and to download iTunes Products previously purchased or acquired from the iTunes Service. You agree that meeting these requirements, which may change from time to time, is your responsibility. The iTunes Service is not part of any other product or offering, and no purchase or obtaining of any other product shall be construed to represent or guarantee you access to the iTunes Service.<BR />
<BR />
YOUR ACCOUNT<BR />
<BR />
As a registered user of the iTunes Service, you may establish an account (&#34;Account&#34;). Don’t reveal your Account information to anyone else. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Account and for all activities that occur on or through your Account, and you agree to immediately notify Apple of any security breach of your Account. Apple shall not be responsible for any losses arising out of the unauthorized use of your Account.<BR />
<BR />
In order to purchase and download iTunes Products from the iTunes Service, you must enter your Apple ID and password or use Touch ID to authenticate your Account for transactions. Once you have authenticated your Account using your Apple ID and password, you will not need to authenticate again for fifteen minutes on your computer or iOS Device; you can choose to allow your computer or Apple TV to remember your password to remain authenticated. During this time, you will be able to purchase and download iTunes Products without re-entering your password. You can turn off the ability to make iTunes Product transactions or change settings to require a password for every transaction by adjusting the settings on your computer, iOS Device, or Apple TV. For more information, please see http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1904 and http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4213. <BR />
<BR />
You agree to provide accurate and complete information when you register with, and as you use, the iTunes Service (&#34;iTunes Registration Data&#34;), and you agree to update your iTunes Registration Data to keep it accurate and complete. You agree that Apple may store and use the iTunes Registration Data you provide for use in maintaining and billing fees to your Account.<BR />
<BR />
AUTOMATIC DELIVERY AND DOWNLOADING PREVIOUS PURCHASES<BR />
<BR />
When you first acquire music, purchased (i.e. not rented) movie, TV show and music video iTunes Products (collectively, “iTunes Eligible Content”), you may elect to automatically receive (“auto-download”) copies of such iTunes Eligible Content on additional compatible iOS Devices (except for purchased movies and TV show iTunes Products) and iTunes-authorized computers with compatible software by associating such iOS Devices and computers subject to the association rules below (each, an “Associated Device”)For each Associated Device, you may specify which type of iTunes Eligible Content, if any, may be auto-downloaded to it. On an Associated Device that is capable of receiving push notifications (“Push-Enabled”), including iOS Devices, the iTunes Eligible Content will auto-download to that Associated Device when it has an Internet connection; on an Associated Device that is not Push-Enabled, iTunes Eligible Content will automatically appear in the download queue and you may manually initiate the download within iTunes.<BR />
<BR />
As an accommodation to you, subsequent to acquiring iTunes Eligible Content, you may download certain of such previously-acquired iTunes Eligible Content onto any Associated Device. Some iTunes Eligible Content that you previously acquired may not be available for subsequent download at any given time, and Apple shall have no liability to you in such event. As you may not be able to subsequently download certain previously-acquired iTunes Eligible Content, once you download an item of iTunes Eligible Content, it is your responsibility not to lose, destroy, or damage it, and you may want to back it up.<BR />
<BR />
Association of Associated Devices is subject to the following terms:<BR />
<BR />
(i) You may auto-download iTunes Eligible Content or download previously-acquired iTunes Eligible Content from an Account on up to 10 Associated Devices, provided no more than 5 are iTunes-authorized computers.<BR />
<BR />
(ii) An Associated Device can be associated with only one Account at any given time.<BR />
<BR />
(iii) You may switch an Associated Device to a different Account only once every 90 days.<BR />
<BR />
(iv) You may download previously-acquired free content onto an unlimited number of devices while it is free on the iTunes Service, but on no more than 5 iTunes-authorized computers.<BR />
<BR />
An Apple TV is not an “Associated Device.” However, TV show iTunes Products and purchased (i.e. not rented) movies iTunes Products may be played back on compatible Apple TVs, provided that you may only play back any such TV show or movie on a limited number of Apple TVs at the same time.<BR />
<BR />
Some pieces of iTunes Eligible Content may be large, and significant data charges may result from delivery of such iTunes Eligible Content over a data connection.<BR />
<BR />
ITUNES MATCH<BR />
<BR />
iTunes Match permits you to remotely access your matched or uploaded songs, and music videos you have purchased with your Account, along with related metadata, playlists, and other information about your iTunes Library (“iTunes Match Content”).<BR />
<BR />
You may subscribe to iTunes Match for an annual fee. You must have a valid credit card on file with iTunes to subscribe. The subscription is non-refundable (except as required by applicable law), and will automatically renew for one-year periods until you cancel. Your account will be charged no more than 24 hours prior to the expiration of the current subscription period. You may cancel automatic renewal by adjusting the iTunes Store account settings on your computer. You will no longer be able to access your iTunes Match Content from iTunes Match after the end of your subscription period.<BR />
<BR />
iTunes Match works with libraries that contain up to 25,000 songs which are either (i) not currently available on the iTunes Service, or (ii) not purchased from the iTunes Service with your Account. Songs that do not meet certain quality criteria or that are not authorized for your computer are not eligible for iTunes Match.<BR />
<BR />
iTunes Match will automatically scan the song files and collect other information that may be used to identify media in your iTunes library, such as the names of songs, song artists or song durations. iTunes Match will use this information to match songs to those currently available on the iTunes Store, and will make matched songs available to you in a format then available on the iTunes Store. If the song is not successfully matched, your copy of the song will be uploaded to Apple in the same format or a format determined by Apple. Apple reserves the right to limit types of content uploaded (for example, excessively large files). Matched or uploaded songs and related metadata will be available for access from an Associated Device that has been enabled for iTunes Match. Association of Associated Devices for iTunes Match is subject to the same terms as Automatic Delivery and Downloading Previous Purchases, and uploaded or matched songs and related information are deemed to be “iTunes Eligible Content.” You may also access iTunes Match Content from compatible Apple TVs, provided that you may only do so on a limited number of Apple TVs at the same time.<BR />
<BR />
When you use iTunes Match, Genius will begin associating information about the media in your iTunes library with your Account; the association with your Account will continue for a period of time after your subscription ends. Apple will otherwise use this information as described in the Privacy Section of this Agreement. You will not be able to disable Genius while using iTunes Match, so if you prefer that we do not collect and use information from your iTunes library in this manner, you should not use iTunes Match.<BR />
<BR />
You hereby agree to use iTunes Match only for lawfully acquired content. Any use for illegitimate content infringes the rights of others and may subject you to civil and criminal penalties, including possible monetary damages, for copyright infringement.<BR />
<BR />
iTunes Match is provided on an “AS IS” basis and may contain errors or inaccuracies that could cause failures, corruption or loss of data and/or information, including music, playlist, and play history, from your computer or device and from peripherals (including, without limitation, servers and other computers) connected thereto. You should back up all data and information on your computer or device and any peripherals prior to using iTunes Match. You expressly acknowledge and agree that all use of iTunes Match is at your sole risk. To the extent permitted by law, Apple shall have no liability with respect to your use of iTunes Match, including the inability to access matched or uploaded content.<BR />
<BR />
PRIVACY<BR />
<BR />
The iTunes Service is subject to Apple&#39;s Privacy Policy at http://www.apple.com/privacy/.<BR />
<BR />
When you opt in to the Genius feature, Apple will, from time to time, automatically collect information that can be used to identify media in your iTunes library on any Genius-enabled device, such as your play history and playlists. This includes media purchased or acquired through iTunes and media obtained from other sources. This information will be stored anonymously and will not be associated with your name or Account. When you use the Genius feature, Apple will use this information and the contents of your iTunes library, as well as other information, to give personalized recommendations to you.<BR />
<BR />
Apple may only use this information and combine it with aggregated information from the iTunes libraries of other users who also opt in to this feature, your iTunes Store purchase history data, aggregated purchase history data from other iTunes Store users, and other information obtained from third parties, to:<BR />
<BR />
• Create personalized playlists for you from your iTunes library.<BR />
<BR />
• Provide you with recommendations regarding media and other products and services that you may wish to purchase or acquire.<BR />
<BR />
• Provide recommendations regarding products and services to other users.<BR />
<BR />
At all times your information will be treated in accordance with Apple’s Privacy Policy.<BR />
<BR />
Once you opt in to the Genius feature, you will be able to create Genius playlists on Genius-capable devices. <BR />
<BR />
If you prefer that we do not collect and use information from your iTunes library in this manner, you should not enable the Genius feature. You can revoke your opt-in choice at any time by turning off the Genius feature from the Store menu in iTunes on your computer or turning off Genius in the Settings on your device.  After you opt out, iTunes will no longer send information about your iTunes library to Apple. If you have elected to share your library from multiple devices, you need to turn off the Genius feature from each device. <BR />
<BR />
By opting in to the Genius feature, you consent to the use of your information as described above and as described in Apple’s Privacy Policy.<BR />
<BR />
CONTENT AVAILABILITY<BR />
<BR />
Apple reserves the right to change content options (including eligibility for particular features) without notice.

You may also contact Thomas Montgomery, Accessibility Response Engineer, 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California 95014, Phone/Fax: 408-783-5512. <BR />
<BR />
USE OF CONTENT<BR />
<BR />
You agree that the iTunes Service and certain iTunes Products include security technology that limits your use of iTunes Products and that, whether or not iTunes Products are limited by security technology, you shall use iTunes Products in compliance with the applicable usage rules established by Apple and its licensors (“Usage Rules”), and that any other use of the iTunes Products may constitute a copyright infringement. Any security technology is an inseparable part of the iTunes Products. Apple reserves the right to modify the Usage Rules at any time. You agree not to violate, circumvent, reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise tamper with any of the security technology related to such Usage Rules for any reason—or to attempt or assist another person to do so. Usage Rules may be controlled and monitored by Apple for compliance purposes, and Apple reserves the right to enforce the Usage Rules without notice to you. You agree not to access the iTunes Service by any means other than through software that is provided by Apple for accessing the iTunes Service. You shall not access or attempt to access an Account that you are not authorized to access. You agree not to modify the software in any manner or form, or to use modified versions of the software, for any purposes including obtaining unauthorized access to the iTunes Service. Violations of system or network security may result in civil or criminal liability.<BR />

Any burning or exporting capabilities are solely an accommodation to you and shall not constitute a grant, waiver, or other limitation of any rights of the copyright owners in any content embodied in any iTunes Product.<BR />
<BR />
You acknowledge that, because some aspects of the iTunes Service, iTunes Products, and administration of the Usage Rules entails the ongoing involvement of Apple, if Apple changes any part of or discontinues the iTunes Service, which Apple may do at its election, you may not be able to use iTunes Products to the same extent as prior to such change or discontinuation, and that Apple shall have no liability to you in such case.<BR />
<BR />
SEASON PASS, MULTI-PASS, ITUNES PASS<BR />

The full price of the Season Pass, Multi-Pass, or iTunes Pass is charged upon purchase. You must connect to the iTunes Service and download any remaining Pass content within 90 days after the final Pass content becomes available (or such other time period as may be specified on the purchase page), after which that content may no longer be available for download as part of the purchase. If automatic renewal is selected when you purchase a Multi-Pass, you will be charged the full price of each subsequent Multi-Pass cycle, unless and until you cancel automatic renewal prior to the beginning of the subsequent Multi-Pass cycle (in the Manage Passes section of your Account information). If a network or studio delivers fewer TV episodes than planned when you purchased a Season Pass, we will credit to your Account the retail value of the corresponding number of episodes.<BR />

C. MAC APP STORE, APP STORE AND IBOOKS STORE TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR />
<BR />
THIS LEGAL AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND APPLE INC. (&#34;APPLE&#34;) GOVERNS YOUR USE OF THE MAC APP STORE, APP STORE AND IBOOKS STORE SERVICES (THE “APP AND BOOK SERVICES”).<BR />
<BR />
THE MAC APP STORE, APP STORE AND IBOOKS STORE SERVICES<BR />
<BR />
Apple is the provider of the App and Book Services that permit you to license software products and digital content (the “App and Book Products”) for end user use only under the terms and conditions set forth in this Agreement. For App Store Products (defined below), end users may be individuals acting in their own capacities, commercial enterprises or educational institutions.<BR />
<BR />
REQUIREMENTS FOR USE OF THE APP AND BOOK SERVICES<BR />
<BR />
Only persons age 13 years or older can create accounts.  Accounts for persons under 13 years old can be created by a parent or legal guardian using Family Sharing or by an approved educational institution.  Children under the age of majority should review this Agreement with their parent or guardian to ensure that the child and the parent or legal guardian understand it.<BR />
<BR />
The App and Book Services are available to you only in the United States, its territories, and possessions. You agree not to use or attempt to use the App and Book Services from outside these locations. Apple may use technologies to verify your compliance.<BR />
<BR />
Use of the App and Book Services requires compatible devices, Internet access, and certain software (fees may apply); may require periodic updates; and may be affected by the performance of these factors. High-speed Internet access is strongly recommended. The latest version of required software (including, but not limited to iTunes and/or Mac App Store software) is recommended to access the App and Book Services and may be required for certain transactions or features and to download App and Book Products previously purchased or acquired from the App and Book Services. You agree that meeting these requirements, which may change from time to time, is your responsibility. The App and Book Services are not part of any other product or offering, and no purchase or obtaining of any other product shall be construed to represent or guarantee you access to the App and Book Services.<BR />
<BR />
YOUR ACCOUNT<BR />
<BR />
As a registered user of the App and Book Services, you may establish an account (&#34;Account&#34;). Don’t reveal your Account information to anyone else. You are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality and security of your Account, and for all activities that occur on or through your Account, and you agree to immediately notify Apple of any security breach of your Account. Apple shall not be responsible for any losses arising out of the unauthorized use of your Account.<BR />
<BR />
In order to purchase and download App and Book Products from the App and Book Services, you must enter your Apple ID and password or use Touch ID to authenticate your Account for transactions. Once you have authenticated your Account using your Apple ID and password, you will not need to authenticate again for fifteen minutes; you can choose to allow your computer to remember your password to remain authenticated. During this time, you will be able to purchase and download App and Book Products without re-entering your password. You can turn off the ability to make App and Book Product transactions or change settings to require a password for every App and Book Product transaction by adjusting the settings on your computer or iOS Device. For more information, please see http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1904 and http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4213.<BR />
<BR />
You agree to provide accurate and complete information when you register with, and as you use, the App and Book Services (&#34;App and Book Registration Data&#34;), and you agree to update your App and Book Registration Data to keep it accurate and complete. You agree that Apple may store and use the App and Book Registration Data you provide for use in maintaining and billing fees to your Account.<BR />
<BR />
AUTOMATIC DELIVERY AND DOWNLOADING PREVIOUS PURCHASES<BR />
<BR />
When you first acquire App Store Products, as defined below, (excluding products acquired from the Mac App Store) or iBooks Store Products, as defined below, through the App and Book Services (collectively, “Eligible Content”), you may elect to automatically receive (“auto-download”) copies of such Eligible Content on additional compatible iOS Devices and iTunes-authorized computers with compatible software by associating such iOS Devices and computers subject to the association rules below (each, an “Associated Device”). For each Associated Device, you may specify which type of Eligible Content, if any, may be auto-downloaded to it. On an Associated Device that is capable of receiving push notifications (“Push-Enabled”), including iOS Devices, the Eligible Content will auto-download to that Associated Device when it has an Internet connection; on an Associated Device that is not Push-Enabled, including those running on the Windows operating system, Eligible Content will automatically appear in the download queue and you may manually initiate the download within iTunes.<BR />
<BR />
As an accommodation to you, subsequent to acquiring Eligible Content, you may download certain of such previously-acquired Eligible Content onto any Associated Device. Some Eligible Content that you previously acquired may not be available for subsequent download at any given time, and Apple shall have no liability to you in such event. As you may not be able to subsequently download certain previously-acquired Eligible Content, once you download an item of Eligible Content, it is your responsibility not to lose, destroy, or damage it, and you may want to back it up.<BR />
<BR />
Association of Associated Devices is subject to the following terms:<BR />
<BR />
(i) You may auto-download Eligible Content or download previously-acquired Eligible Content from an Account on up to 10 Associated Devices, provided no more than 5 are iTunes-authorized computers.<BR />
<BR />
(ii) An Associated Device can be associated with only one Account at any given time.<BR />
<BR />
(iii) You may switch an Associated Device to a different Account only once every 90 days.<BR />
<BR />
(iv) You may download previously-acquired free content onto an unlimited number of devices while it is free on the App and Book Services, but on no more than 5 iTunes-authorized computers.<BR />
<BR />
The above terms (i) to (iv) do not apply to App Store Products.<BR />
<BR />
Some pieces of Eligible Content may be large, and significant data charges may result from delivery of such Eligible Content over a data connection.<BR />
<BR />
AUTOMATIC DELIVERY OF UPDATES<BR />
<BR />
Your device or computer will periodically check with the App Store and Mac App Store for updates to the apps on your device or computer and, if available, the update may automatically download and install. You agree that Apple, through the App Store and Mac App Store, may automatically download and install updates onto your device(s) or computer. You can turn off automatic updates altogether at any time by changing the automatic updates settings on your device or computer.<BR />
<BR />
APP BUNDLES<BR />
<BR />
Some App Store Products may contain multiple items (“App Bundles”).  The price displayed with an App Bundle is the price you will be charged upon purchasing the App Bundle. The App Bundle price may be reduced to account for App Store Products you have already purchased or acquired, but may include a minimum charge to complete the App Bundle. <BR />
<BR />
PRIVACY<BR />
<BR />
The App and Book Services are subject to Apple&#39;s Privacy Policy at http://www.apple.com/privacy/.<BR />
<BR />
USE OF APP AND BOOK PRODUCTS AND THE APP AND BOOK SERVICES<BR />
<BR />
You agree that the App and Book Services and certain App and Book Products include security technology that limits your use of App and Book Products and that, whether or not App and Book Products are limited by security technology, you shall use App and Book Products in compliance with the applicable usage rules established by Apple and its principals (“Usage Rules”), and that any other use of the App and Book Products may constitute a copyright infringement. Any security technology is an inseparable part of the App and Book Products. Apple reserves the right to modify the Usage Rules at any time. You agree not to violate, circumvent, reverse-engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise tamper with any of the security technology related to such Usage Rules for any reason—or to attempt or assist another person to do so. Usage Rules may be controlled and monitored by Apple for compliance purposes, and Apple reserves the right to enforce the Usage Rules without notice to you. You agree not to access the App and Book Services by any means other than through software that is provided by Apple for accessing the App and Book Services. You shall not access or attempt to access an Account that you are not authorized to access. You agree not to modify the software in any manner or form, or to use modified versions of the software, for any purposes including obtaining unauthorized access to the App and Book Services. Violations of system or network security may result in civil or criminal liability.<BR />
<BR />
The delivery of App and Book Products does not transfer to you any promotional use rights in the App and Book Products.<BR />
<BR />
You acknowledge that, because some aspects of the App and Book Services, App and Book Products, and administration of the Usage Rules entails the ongoing involvement of Apple, if Apple changes any part of or discontinues the App and Book Services, which Apple may do at its election, you may not be able to use App and Book Products to the same extent as prior to such change or discontinuation, and that Apple shall have no liability to you in such case.<BR />

ADDITIONAL MAC APP STORE AND APP STORE TERMS AND CONDITIONS<BR />
<BR />
LICENSE OF MAC APP STORE AND APP STORE PRODUCTS<BR />
<BR />
The software products made available through the Mac App Store and App Store (collectively, the “App Store Products”) are licensed, not sold, to you. There are two (2) categories of App Store Products, as follows: (i) those App Store Products that have been developed, and are licensed to you, by Apple (“Apple Products”); and (ii) those App Store Products that have been developed, and are licensed to you, by a third-party developer (“Third-Party Products”). The category of a particular App Store Product (Apple Product or Third-Party Product) is identified on the Mac App Store application or App Store application.<BR />
<BR />
Your license to each App Store Product is subject to the Licensed Application End User License Agreement set forth below, and you agree that such terms will apply unless the App Store Product is covered by a valid end user license agreement entered into between you and the licensor of that App Store Product (the “Application Provider”), in which case the Application Provider’s end user license agreement will apply to that App Store Product. The Application Provider reserves all rights in and to the App Store Product not expressly granted to you.<BR />
<BR />
You acknowledge that the license to each Apple Product that you obtain through the App Store Services, as defined below, or you associate with your Account, is a binding agreement between you and Apple. You acknowledge that: you are acquiring the license to each Third-Party Product from the Application Provider; Apple is acting as agent for the Application Provider in providing each such Third-Party Product to you; and Apple is not a party to the license between you and the Application Provider with respect to that Third-Party Product. The Application Provider of each Third-Party Product is solely responsible for that Third-Party Product, the content therein, any warranties to the extent that such warranties have not been disclaimed, and any claims that you or any other party may have relating to that Third-Party Product.<BR />
<BR />
You acknowledge and agree that Apple and its subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of the Licensed Application End User License Agreement or the Application Provider’s end user license agreement, as the case may be, for each Third-Party Product. You also agree that, upon your acceptance of the terms and conditions of the license to any such Third-Party Product, Apple will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce such license against you as a third-party beneficiary thereof.<BR />
<BR />
IN-APP PURCHASES<BR />
<BR />
Certain App Store Products may include functionality that enables you to receive additional services, or licenses to additional functionality or content for use within the App Store Product (&#34;In App Purchases&#34;). In App Purchases that are consumed during the use of the App Store Product (for example, virtual ammunition) cannot be transferred among devices; can be downloaded only once; and after being downloaded, cannot be replaced. Once a consumable In App Purchase is acquired and received by you, Apple shall be without liability to you in the event of any loss, destruction, or damage. All In App Purchases are deemed App Store Products, and In App Purchases received within Third-Party Products are deemed Third-Party Products, and treated as such, for purposes of these terms and conditions.<BR />
<BR />
You must authenticate to acquire In-App Purchases separately from any authentication to obtain App Store Products by entering your password when prompted, but once you have authenticated to obtain an In-App Purchase, you will be able to acquire additional In-App Purchases for fifteen minutes without re-entering your password. You can turn off the ability to acquire In-App Purchases on your iOS Device by following the steps outlined at http://support.apple.com/kb/HT4213.<BR />
<BR />
IN-APP SUBSCRIPTIONS<BR />
<BR />
Certain App Store Products may include functionality that enables you to acquire content on a subscription basis (“In App Subscriptions”). Paid In App Subscriptions are non-refundable. In App Subscriptions will automatically renew for the applicable time period you have selected, and, where applicable, your Account will be charged no more than 24-hours prior to the expiration of the current In App Subscription period. You may cancel automatic renewal of paid In App Subscriptions by selecting Manage App Subscriptions in your Account and selecting the subscription you want to modify. The auto-renew feature of the subscription will be turned off if the Application Provider increases the price of the subscription. You may cancel free In App Subscriptions by deleting the App Store Product from your device. Certain paid In App Subscriptions may offer a free trial period prior to charging your Account. If you decide you do not want to purchase the In App Subscription, turn off auto-renewal in your Account settings during the free trial period. Certain In App Subscriptions may be designated as “Newsstand” products, in which case they will appear only within the Newsstand application on your device after download. You should also review additional information about the paid In App Subscription offer at the point of sale within the App Store Product. We may ask for your permission to provide the name, email address and zip code listed in your Account to the Application Provider so that the Application Provider can send you marketing messages about its own products in accordance with its publicly posted privacy policy. Once the Application Provider has this information, it will be treated in accordance with the Application Provider’s privacy policy. We encourage you to learn about the privacy practices of the Application Provider before agreeing to give it your personal information. For more information, please review the Application Provider’s privacy policy or contact the Application Provider directly.<BR />

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION<BR />
<BR />
To avoid muscle, joint, or eye strain during video game play, you should always take frequent breaks from playing, and take a longer rest if you experience any soreness, fatigue, or discomfort. A very small percentage of people may experience seizures or blackouts when exposed to flashing lights or patterns, including while playing video games or watching videos. Symptoms may include dizziness, nausea, involuntary movements, loss of awareness, altered vision, tingling, numbness, or other discomforts. Consult a doctor before playing video games if you have ever suffered these or similar symptoms, and stop playing immediately and see a doctor if they occur during game play. Parents should monitor their children’s video game play for signs of symptoms.<BR />

LICENSED APPLICATION END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT<BR />
<BR />
The Mac App Store Products and App Store Products (collectively, “App Store Product(s)”) made available through the Mac App Store Service and App Store Service (collectively, “App Store Service(s)”) are licensed, not sold, to you. Your license to each App Store Product that you obtain through the App Store Services or associate with your Account is subject to your prior acceptance of this Licensed Application End User License Agreement (“Standard EULA”), and you agree that the terms of this Standard EULA will apply to each App Store Product that you license through the App Store Service, unless that App Store Product is covered by a valid end user license agreement between you and the Application Provider of that App Store Product, in which case the terms of that separate end user license agreement will govern. Your license to any Apple Product under this Standard EULA or separate end user license agreement is granted by Apple, and your license to any Third-Party Product under this Standard EULA or separate end user license agreement is granted by the Application Provider of that Third-Party Product. Any App Store Product that is subject to the license granted under this Standard EULA is referred to herein as the “Licensed Application”. The Application Provider or Apple as applicable (“Licensor”) reserves all rights in and to the Licensed Application not expressly granted to you under this Standard EULA.<BR />
<BR />
a. Scope of License: This license granted to you for the Licensed Application by Licensor is limited to a nontransferable license to use the Licensed Application on any Apple-branded products running iOS (including but not limited to iPad, iPhone, and iPod touch) (“iOS Devices”) or Mac OS X (“Mac Computers”), as applicable (collectively, “Apple Device(s)”) that you own or control and as permitted by the usage rules set forth in the Mac App Store, App Store and iBooks Store Terms and Conditions (the “Usage Rules”). This license does not allow you to use the Licensed Application on any Apple Device that you do not own or control, and except as provided in the Usage Rules, you may not distribute or make the Licensed Application available over a network where it could be used by multiple devices at the same time. You may not rent, lease, lend, sell, transfer redistribute, or sublicense the Licensed Application and, if you sell your Mac Computer or iOS Device to a third party, you must remove the Licensed Application from the Mac Computer or iOS Device before doing so. You may not copy (except as expressly permitted by this license and the Usage Rules), decompile, reverse-engineer, disassemble, attempt to derive the source code of, modify, or create derivative works of the Licensed Application, any updates, or any part thereof (except as and only to the extent that any foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable law or to the extent as may be permitted by the licensing terms governing use of any open-sourced components included with the Licensed Application). Any attempt to do so is a violation of the rights of the Licensor and its licensors. If you breach this restriction, you may be subject to prosecution and damages.<BR />
<BR />
The terms of this license will govern any upgrades provided by Licensor that replace and/or supplement the original Licensed Application, unless such upgrade is accompanied by a separate license in which case the terms of that license will govern.<BR />
<BR />
b. Consent to Use of Data: You agree that Licensor may collect and use technical data and related information—including but not limited to technical information about your device, system and application software, and peripherals—that is gathered periodically to facilitate the provision of software updates, product support, and other services to you (if any) related to the Licensed Application. Licensor may use this information, as long as it is in a form that does not personally identify you, to improve its products or to provide services or technologies to you.<BR />
<BR />
c. Termination. The license is effective until terminated by you or Licensor. Your rights under this license will terminate automatically without notice from the Licensor if you fail to comply with any term(s) of this license. Upon termination of the license, you shall cease all use of the Licensed Application and destroy all copies, full or partial, of the Licensed Application.<BR />

No portion of the External Services may be reproduced in any form or by any means. You agree not to modify, rent, lease, loan, sell, distribute, or create derivative works based on the External Services, in any manner, and you shall not exploit the External Services in any unauthorized way whatsoever, including but not limited to, using the External Services to transmit any computer viruses, worms, trojan horses or other malware, or by trespass or burdening network capacity.

<BR />
In addition, External Services and Third Party Materials that may be accessed from, displayed on or linked to from the Apple Devices are not available in all languages or in all countries or regions. Licensor makes no representation that such External Services and Materials are appropriate or available for use in any particular location. To the extent you choose to use or access such External Services and Materials, you do so at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with any applicable laws, including but not limited to applicable local laws. Licensor reserves the right to change, suspend, remove, or disable access to any External Services at any time without notice. In no event will Licensor be liable for the removal of or disabling of access to any such External Services. Licensor may also impose limits on the use of or access to certain External Services, in any case and without notice or liability.<BR />

NO ORAL OR WRITTEN INFORMATION OR ADVICE GIVEN BY LICENSOR OR ITS AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE A WARRANTY. SHOULD THE LICENSED APPLICATION OR SERVICES PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR CORRECTION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES OR LIMITATIONS ON APPLICABLE STATUTORY RIGHTS OF A CONSUMER, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION AND LIMITATIONS MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<BR />
<BR />
f. Limitation of Liability.
